This is a app I made to sort files and folders on your computer. This is still in the beginning stages and I am updating and improving it daily. 
How to use:
In folder entry enter the name you want to call folder. You can add multiple folders at a time
-in the file type and keyword, enter what you want to find the file or folder as.
once you click start the app will run and add files to the new folders you created.
Working on getting the app to run consistently.
Click stop to stop the app from moving.
